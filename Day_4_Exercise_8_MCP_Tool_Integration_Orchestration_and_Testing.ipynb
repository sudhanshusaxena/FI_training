    "# Day 4 - Exercise 8: Model Context Protocol (MCP) with RAG Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities using LangGraph and LiteLLM with OpenAI API. MCP enriches machine learning models with contextual information, while RAG enhances responses with external knowledge retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. **MCP Integration**: Learn how to implement Model Context Protocol for contextual awareness\n",
    "2. **RAG Implementation**: Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation with vector databases\n",
    "3. **Context-Aware Responses**: Create personalized responses based on user context\n",
    "4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Implement semantic search and document retrieval\n",
    "5. **Advanced Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow orchestration with MCP and RAG\n",
    "6. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of MCP and RAG performance\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, please ensure your OpenAI API key is properly configured:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check your .env file** in the same directory as this notebook\n",
    "2. **Set your API key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`\n",
    "3. **Replace the placeholder**: The current .env file has a placeholder key that needs to be replaced\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you don't have an API key:**\n",
    "- Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n",
    "- Create a new API key\n",
    "- Copy it to your .env file\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you don't want to use API calls:**\n",
    "- The notebook will run in demo mode with mock data\n",
    "- All functionality will be demonstrated without actual LLM calls\n",
    "- Perfect for understanding the concepts and code structure\n"

    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use MCP when you need:**\n",
    "- **Personalization**: Tailor responses based on user preferences, role, or experience level\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Adapt behavior based on device type, location, or session data\n",
    "- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Change response style, detail level, or format based on context\n",
    "- **User State Management**: Track and utilize user session information\n",
    "- **Device Optimization**: Optimize responses for mobile vs desktop experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- HR assistant that provides different explanations for managers vs employees\n",
    "- Customer service chatbot that adapts tone based on user's previous interactions\n",
    "- Educational platform that adjusts complexity based on student's learning level\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use RAG when you need:**\n",
    "- **Document Retrieval**: Find relevant information from large knowledge bases\n",
    "- **Version Management**: Intelligently select between different document versions\n",
    "- **Factual Accuracy**: Ensure responses are based on up-to-date, verified information\n",
    "- **Knowledge Integration**: Combine information from multiple sources\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content even with different wording\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- HR policy lookup with automatic version selection (V1 vs V2)\n",
    "- Technical documentation search across multiple manuals\n",
    "- Legal document analysis with precedent retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Combined MCP + RAG Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use both when you need:**\n",
    "- **Intelligent Document Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant docs AND personalize the presentation\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Knowledge**: Find the right information AND adapt it to the user's context\n",
    "- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest relevant policies AND tailor explanations to user role\n",
    "- **Adaptive Information Delivery**: Retrieve facts AND optimize delivery format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenarios:**\n",
    "- HR assistant that finds the right policy version AND explains it appropriately for the user's role\n",
    "- Customer support that retrieves relevant documentation AND adapts the explanation to customer's technical level\n",
    "- Educational platform that finds relevant learning materials AND adjusts presentation based on student's device and preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Token Usage Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCP Context Processing**: ~10-50 tokens per context update\n",
    "- **RAG Retrieval**: ~20-100 tokens per document search\n",
    "- **LLM Generation**: ~100-1000 tokens per response (varies by length)\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "AI Analysis:\n",
      "1. Leave balance transfer recommendations:\n",
      "- Since the employee worked 6 months in India and 6 months in the USA, it is recommended to transfer a portion of their leave balance from India to the USA to ensure a fair allocation of leave benefits.\n",
      "- The transfer should be based on a pro-rata calculation considering the total tenure of 12 months and the respective entitlements in each country.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Compliance considerations for both countries:\n",
      "- In India, the employee is entitled to annual leave, sick leave, and casual leave as per the local labor laws. It is important to ensure that the transfer of leave balance complies with the regulations in India.\n",
      "- In the USA, the employee is entitled to vacation, sick, and personal leave as per the company's policies and state laws. Compliance with the relevant regulations in the USA is essential when transferring leave balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fair leave allocation strategy:\n",
      "- To ensure a fair allocation of leave benefits, the transfer should be done in a way that balances the employee's total leave entitlements from both countries.\n",
      "- A pro-rata calculation based on the total tenure of 12 months can be used to determine the amount of leave balance to be transferred from India to the USA.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Potential challenges and solutions:\n",
      "- Challenge: Varying leave entitlements and regulations in India and the USA may make it challenging to determine the appropriate transfer of leave balance.\n",
      "  Solution: Consult with HR professionals or legal experts in both countries to ensure compliance with local regulations and fair allocation of leave benefits.\n",
      "- Challenge: Communication and coordination between HR departments in India and the USA for the leave balance transfer process.\n",
      "  Solution: Establish clear communication channels and protocols for transferring leave balances between the two countries to ensure a smooth and transparent process for the employee.\n",
      "- Challenge: Employee dissatisfaction or confusion regarding the leave balance transfer process.\n",
      "  Solution: Provide clear explanations and guidelines to the employee regarding the transfer of leave balances, including how it is calculated and the benefits they are entitled to in each country. Address any concerns or questions promptly to ensure employee satisfaction.\n",

    "## 📊 Summary Statistics: Comprehensive Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Summary Statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary statistics are numerical measures that describe the main features of a dataset in a concise and meaningful way. In the context of our RAG vs MCP evaluation system, they provide a quantitative overview of performance across multiple test scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Summary Statistics Explained:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Response Time Statistics**\n",
    "- **Mean Response Time**: Average time taken across all test scenarios\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of variability in response times\n",
    "- **Min/Max Response Time**: Fastest and slowest response times observed\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Helps identify which system is consistently faster\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Token Usage Statistics**\n",
    "- **Total Tokens Used**: Sum of all tokens consumed across scenarios\n",
    "- **Average Tokens per Query**: Mean token consumption per test case\n",
    "- **Token Efficiency Ratio**: Comparison of token usage between RAG and MCP\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Measures computational efficiency and cost implications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Quality Score Statistics**\n",
    "- **Mean Quality Score**: Average evaluation score across all metrics\n",
    "- **Score Distribution**: How scores are spread across different quality dimensions\n",
    "- **Win Rate**: Percentage of scenarios where one system outperforms the other\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Quantifies overall response quality and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Performance Metrics**\n",
    "- **Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of correct or highly relevant responses\n",
    "- **Consistency Score**: Measure of how consistent performance is across scenarios\n",
    "- **Reliability Index**: Statistical measure of system dependability\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Evaluates system reliability and predictability\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Summary Statistics Matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comparative Analysis**: Direct comparison between RAG and MCP systems\n",
    "2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics\n",
    "3. **Decision Making**: Data-driven selection of the best system for specific use cases\n",
    "4. **Trend Identification**: Spot patterns and performance trends\n",
    "5. **Resource Planning**: Understand computational requirements and costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statistical Significance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size**: Based on 20 test queries across different complexity levels\n",
    "- **Confidence Level**: 95% confidence interval for statistical validity\n",
    "- **P-Value**: Statistical significance of performance differences\n",
    "- **Effect Size**: Magnitude of practical difference between systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Interpretation Guidelines:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Scores = Better Performance**: For quality metrics (1-10 scale)\n",
    "- **Lower Values = Better Performance**: For response time and token usage\n",
    "- **Significant Difference**: When p-value < 0.05 and effect size > 0.5\n",
    "- **Practical Significance**: When differences exceed 10% threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Selection**: Choose between RAG and MCP based on specific requirements\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Identify areas for improvement\n",
    "- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate operational costs based on token usage\n",
    "- **Scalability Planning**: Predict performance at different scales\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure consistent performance across use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive statistical analysis provides the foundation for making informed decisions about which system to use in different scenarios and contexts.\n"
