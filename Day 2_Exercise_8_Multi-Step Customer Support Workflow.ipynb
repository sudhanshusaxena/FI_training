    "# Day 2 – Exercise 8: Advanced Multi‑Step Customer Support Workflow (Enterprise)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this advanced exercise you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build** a multi‑step customer support agent that performs classification, retrieval, answer generation, ticket creation, and summarization.\n",
    "- **Integrate** baseline and LLM‑based classifiers (via RealLight/LiteLLM) to understand different approaches to intent routing.\n",
    "- **Simulate** retrieval using BM25, dense, and hybrid strategies and track metadata such as document counts and sources.\n",
    "- **Capture** detailed logs (including latency and cost estimates) and compute metrics like classification accuracy, success rate, and average cost.\n",
    "- **Analyze** failure patterns and plan improvements for a production MVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intent Classification:** Compare rule‑based, logistic regression, and LLM classifiers.\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Strategies:** Route queries to BM25, dense, or hybrid retrievers and track citations.\n",
    "3. **Multi‑Step Orchestration:** Design a workflow that answers questions, creates tickets when unresolved, and summarizes interactions.\n",
    "4. **Observability & Metrics:** Log interactions with metrics such as latency and cost to inform system optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 120 minutes\n"

    "- `pandas==2.2.0` for data handling\n",
    "- `scikit‑learn==1.4.0` for the logistic regression classifier\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accuracy vs. Success Rate:** Even with similar classification accuracy, the downstream success rate may differ because misrouted queries lead to less effective retrieval and more tickets.\n",
    "- **Latency & Cost:** The logistic regression model has comparable latency and cost since our retrieval stubs and simulated token counts dominate. Using an LLM classifier would increase cost and latency, so you might adopt a hybrid strategy (fast model first, LLM fallback).\n",
    "- **Failure Patterns:** Inspect misclassified intents and the content of unresolved answers to understand why tickets were created. You might need better keyword coverage or training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increase Training Data:** More labeled examples per intent and category will improve the logistic regression classifier and provide better few-shot examples for the LLM.\n",
    "2. **Hybrid Routing:** Use a lightweight classifier for most queries and call the LLM only on uncertain cases to balance cost and accuracy.\n",
    "3. **Real Retrieval Integration:** Replace stubs with ElasticSearch for BM25 and FAISS/Chroma for dense retrieval. Track document IDs for citations.\n",
    "4. **Ticketing Integration:** Connect to your actual support ticket system (e.g., via REST API) to open and update tickets.\n",
    "5. **Observability:** Use tracing and monitoring tools to record latency distributions, cost, and user satisfaction metrics, then set alerts for anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iterating on these recommendations, you'll move closer to a production‑ready, enterprise‑grade customer support agent.\n"

    "- Generated answers via an LLM (RealLight) and simulated token‑based cost and latency.\n",

    "# Day 2 – Exercise 8 (Part B): Multi‑Step Customer Support Workflow – Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This continuation builds on the previous exercise and implements the **improvement recommendations** to move closer to a production‑ready support agent. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expand the training data** to improve the logistic regression classifier.\n",
    "2. **Implement hybrid routing**, using a confidence threshold to decide when to call an LLM.\n",
    "3. **Demonstrate real retrieval integration** with ElasticSearch (BM25) and FAISS/Chroma (dense). We use placeholders and pseudo‑code where external services are required.\n",
    "4. **Show how to integrate with an external ticketing system** via a REST API (simulated).\n",
    "5. **Add observability instrumentation** by collecting and logging latency and cost metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll understand how to enhance the initial prototype into a robust, enterprise‑grade workflow.\n"

    "- **Tracing:** Use libraries like `opentelemetry` to instrument each step (classification, retrieval, LLM call). Export traces to a backend (e.g., Jaeger or Tempo) for visual inspection.\n",
    "- **Metrics:** Record latency, error rates, and token usage to a monitoring system (Prometheus, Datadog) and define SLOs (service level objectives).\n",
    "- **Logging:** Use structured logging (JSON) with context fields (query, intent, ticket ID, cost) and send to a log aggregator.\n",
