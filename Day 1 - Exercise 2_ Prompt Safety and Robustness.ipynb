    "# Day 1 - Exercise 2: Prompt Safety and Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build safe and cost-aware prompts by incorporating guardrails and analyzing tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add guardrails** to prompts from Ex1 to enforce style (e.g., formal tone), safety (e.g., avoid harmful content), and robustness mechanisms\n",
    "- **Perform a jailbreak check** by testing adversarial inputs to ensure robustness\n",
    "- **Tokenization analysis** for the prompts using GPT-2 or LLaMA tokenizer; calculate token counts and estimate API costs for 100 queries\n",
    "- **Cost optimization** understanding how to design robust prompts and the cost implications of token usage in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic Demonstrated:** Understand how to design robust prompts and the cost implications of token usage in LLMs. Guardrails prevent undesirable outputs, and tokenization awareness optimizes cost and efficiency.\n",
