    "## 📚 **Theory & Foundation: Understanding Hallucination in RAG Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Hallucination in RAG?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hallucination** refers to the generation of information that is:\n",
    "- **Factually incorrect**: Contradicts the retrieved context\n",
    "- **Not grounded**: Not supported by the source documents\n",
    "- **Fabricated**: Completely made up by the language model\n",
    "- **Misleading**: Partially correct but contains errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Hallucinations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Contextual Hallucination**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Information not present in the retrieved context\n",
    "- **Example**: Answer mentions \"Company X was founded in 1995\" when context only says \"Company X is a technology company\"\n",
    "- **Detection**: Check if claims are supported by retrieved documents\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Factual Hallucination**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Incorrect factual information\n",
    "- **Example**: \"The capital of France is London\" (should be Paris)\n",
    "- **Detection**: Cross-reference with authoritative sources\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Temporal Hallucination**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Incorrect time-related information\n",
    "- **Example**: \"The company launched in 2023\" when context says \"2022\"\n",
    "- **Detection**: Extract and validate temporal entities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Numerical Hallucination**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Incorrect numbers, statistics, or measurements\n",
    "- **Example**: \"Revenue increased by 150%\" when context says \"50%\"\n",
    "- **Detection**: Extract and validate numerical claims\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Citation Validation Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Citation Quality Metrics**\n",
    "1. **Citation Accuracy**: Do citations support the claims?\n",
    "2. **Citation Completeness**: Are all claims supported by citations?\n",
    "3. **Citation Relevance**: Are cited passages relevant to the claim?\n",
    "4. **Citation Attribution**: Are sources properly attributed?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Validation Approaches**\n",
    "1. **Automated Detection**: Rule-based and ML-based methods\n",
    "2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Expert review and correction\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine automated and human validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Enterprise Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Risk Assessment**\n",
    "- **High-Risk Domains**: Medical, legal, financial advice\n",
    "- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory standards for accuracy\n",
    "- **Reputation Management**: Brand protection through accuracy\n",
    "- **Liability Reduction**: Minimizing misinformation risks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Quality Assurance**\n",
    "- **Validation Pipelines**: Automated quality checks\n",
    "- **Human Review**: Expert validation for critical content\n",
    "- **Audit Trails**: Documentation of validation decisions\n",
    "- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing quality assessment\n",

    "**💡 Interpretation**: This establishes the foundation for our hallucination detection system.\n",
